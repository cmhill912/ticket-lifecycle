<h3>
<h4> Creating a New Ticket</h4>

1.) First you will need to create a ticket, to do so log in to osTicket as one of the users you created, in this case "Karen Jones". Once logged in, click "submit new ticket as shown below.

2.) Next, create the ticket and provide the agent with the information they will need to fix the problem, in this case Karen has reported that her employees are reporting that customers can no longer access their online banking accounts. Once submitted log out of the user account and log in to the account of one of the agents with the credentials you created. Upon logging in, click the ticket, where you will be redirected to a details screen, this will provide the agent with all the necessary details from the user to provide support for the problem

3.) Upon inspecting the ticket, deduce the severity of the problem and update the SLA accordingly as well as assigning it to a certain agent if you would like.

4.) Now, the agent who will be working on the ticket, in this case "Christian Hill" has realized the urgency of the issue, noted it and reassigned the ticket to a more senior member "Jane Smith"

5.) Next, Jane Smith will access the ticket and communicate to the user "Karen Jones" that they will be working with "Karen" to solve the problem. Jane will do this using the reply feature towards the bottom of the screen.

6.) With all this said, at this point you would begin brainstorming and attempting to use solutions to the problem. In this case, "Jane" attempts to revert the updates to the online banking program with the thinking that this will resolve the access issue.

7.) Jane comes back to communicate that the issue has been identified as coming from the recent updates and lets Karen know that the rollbacks should immediately fix the functionality issue and thanks Karen for her patience as the ticket will be getting closed shortly.

<h4> Closing of Ticket</h4>

8.) With the ticket now resolved, the lifecycle of this ticket is complete, I recommend trying this with multiple scenarios and multiple different agents to get a feel for assigning SLAs, transfering tickets from department to department or agent to agent.
